# Vertical Carriage for Kossel 3D printer. #

This is the paramereized version of the Cerberus pup vertical carriage made by Steve Graber.

Made from scratch with modifications by me for belt support in different directions and positions as I love flexible and customizable designs, where you only need one which can be modified to your liking.
